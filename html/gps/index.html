		<h2>The purpose of semantic tags in html</h2>
		<UL>
			<li>To provide clear semantics in html that can later be styled appropraitely with CSS</li>
			<li>Makes it easier for search engines to identify correct web page content</li>
			<li>Update from html4 using non semantic tags with IDs to clearly use semantics</li>
		</UL>
		<h2>What is the order that the browser uses to display elements on a page?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The order is done by sections, so like the first block element is looked at then any line elements inside the block, until it gets either to a block inside the parent block or the second parent block element</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>What did you learn about sublime in this challenge?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I learned about snippets, and that alt+click+drag will select items in a vertical direction for easy indentation or editing</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Finding out what the order of display the broswer uses, I still do not fully know but I guess it is line by line... I have tried looking it up now for about an hour.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Purpose of HTML5 Semantic Tags, and most useful</h3>
			<p>The reason we use semantic tags is section things out in a meaningful way so that CSS style can be applied to whole sections of code. Some semantic tags are section, header, footer, article, nav, etc. I think these are all useful because each of these sections is separate from one another, and can be styled separately, but I think header and footer are especially useful.</p>
		<h3>Order the browser uses to display elements</h3>
			<p>The browser displays from least important to most important, or least specific to most specific. Browsers have their own build in default styles, which are used unless something else has been written in a CSS style sheet. And the CSS style for a selector will be over-written if there is a CSS style specified for a class or id. So it's really about displaying them in a cascading order of importance.</p>
		<h3>Sublime and snippets</h3>
			<p>It was really cool to see how to write a snippet; the example that we wrote was cool because it was a lot of different lines, but then it would set you up at the beginning of the line. I could see that being really useful for if you have something in a file that is repeated over and over, but requires a lot of setup, like our table did.</p>
		<h3>Most challenging concept</h3>
			<p>I feel as though I have a pretty good handle on HTML in general, so it was nice to practice all of the different tags. I do sometimes have a hard time distinguishing when to use a div versus a section, and some of the other semantic tags seem very similar to me too.</p>
